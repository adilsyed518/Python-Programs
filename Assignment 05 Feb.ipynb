    "A class is a type of blueprint that you can use to make objects. A concrete 'thing' that you constructed using a certain class is an object. Classes are a kind of factory for creating multiple Objects.Object is a generic term , it is physically present but remains undifferentiated . Instance is something that gives them a separate identity.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "The “self” parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class. It does not have to be named \"self\", you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class. By using the “self” we can access the attributes and methods of the class in python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments.\n",

    "Q5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. In Python, a class can inherit attributes and methods from a parent class, also known as a base class or superclass, to create a new child class or subclass. The child class inherits the characteristics of the parent class, and it can add its own attributes and methods or override the inherited ones. This promotes code reuse and facilitates the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOPs support the six different types of inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single inheritance: derived class is created from a single base class\n",

    "# Driver's code\n",

    "object.func2()\n",
    "# Output\n",
    "This function is in parent class.\n",
    "This function is in child class.\n",
